# Whatsapp-Backup-Tool
### For questions: ask me on Discord at *<kendrik2.0>*
--> Tool to view whatsapp backups in a html-site you can open in your browser (only pc for now).
You will be able to export your chat, run the .py and view your content through a whatsapp-like-styled local site.

## Issue to resolve:
You can choose to export your whatsapp chats (also with media) in the app. 
However, this forces you to look through an endless .zip file with all medias and documents thrown together and your whole chat stored in a single, tough-to-read .txt file. 
Especially if you want to export your chat as a backup to actually look through old memories, the export function alone is not a feasable method.

## Solution:
The tool will be a simple python script which you run, it will guide you through the progress and create a .html with css to view your backup in a nice, modernized way. 
The goal is also to get as close as possible to the feeling of an actual chat you would have opened (on your pc).

## Progress:
The tool is currently still in progress. I hope to be able to release a first version soon.  
### edit: development of this currently (24.05.25) halted due to other projects I'm working on.  
I would like to continue working on this in the future tho :) If you would interested in a first final version release soon, please contact me.  
 
For a first sneak-peek of what I'd like the result to look like (don't mind the timestamps please, this is just a demo):

## Goals for this project:
- I'm working with certain locales currently, other app languages use different formats, which I will have to include aswell.
- Optimize for groups with more than 2 users.
- Optimize for viewing more screen sizes than just laptop. Maybe also for phones
